    "Tipper systems collect three orthogonal components of the ambient magnetic field ($H_x,\\;H_y,\\;H_z$). Similar to magnetotelluric surveys, the ratios of the components are used to circumvent the unknown source of the EM signal. The transfer functions, or tipper, are calculated by taking the ratio of the fields for two polarizations of the magnetic fields (EW and NS). The measurements are generally provided in the frequency-domain with both a real and an imaginary component.
