# # Fundamentals
#
# This module documents the use of [SimPEG](simpeg.xyz) for geophysical data inversion with user-interface (UIjson) made
# available through the [Mira Geoscience-geoapps](https://mirageoscience-geoapps.readthedocs-hosted.com/) project.
# While the code itself has its own documentation, there is a need to demonstrate the effect of parameters controlling
# the inversion.
# This document is meant to be a reference guide with practical examples to help practitioners with their inversion work.
