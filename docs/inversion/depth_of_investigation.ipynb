    "# Depth of Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "In geophysics, \"depth of investigation\" refers to the maximum depth below the surface from which a geophysical survey can reliably measure. It depends on factors like the survey design and physical properties of the subsurface material. Several strategies have been proposed to assess uncertainties in models recovered from inversion. Nabighian & Macnae (1989) used a skin depth approach for electromagnetic surveys, assuming a background halfspace resistivity. Li&O (1999) implemented a cut-off value based on two inverted models obtained with slightly different assumptions. Christiansen & Auken (2012) proposed a mask based on the sum-square of sensitivities to estimate a volume of low confidence. In the following, we discuss the algorithm and implementation of the sensitivity cutoff strategy."

In the percent method the data are transformed into a percentage of the largest value\n",
