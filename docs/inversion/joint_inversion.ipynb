A ground direct-current survey on the other hand is highly sensitive to near surface changes in resisivity.

    "The more general joint inversion strategy tries to find commonality between different physical properties models.  The goal is to invert for a `common Earth model` based on multiple geophysical surveys that might provide complementary information. For example, one could invert a direct-current resisitivity survey for the thickness of overburden, along with a gravity survey to highlight the density of targets under cover. Both geophysical survey are sensitive to different components of the sub-surface, but can greatly help each other in reducing ambiguity about the position and shape of physical property contrasts.\n",
