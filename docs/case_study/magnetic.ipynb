The inducing field parameters are used instead. After running the forward simulation, we obtain RMI data as shown in [Figure X](mag_data). We note the strong correlation between the amplitude of the signal and the horizontal position of the ore body. There is also a significant East-West trend due to the weakly magnetic but large Hidden Formation.\n",
