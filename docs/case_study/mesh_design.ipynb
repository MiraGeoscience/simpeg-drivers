    "This section provides details about the mesh creation for the individual inversions using the `Octree Mesh Creation` routine from [Mirageoscience\\geoapps](https://mirageoscience-octree-creation-app.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest) package. The goal is to create inversion meshes that are well adapted to each survey, while also optimal for the subsequent joint inversion process.\n",

    "- [Base cell resolution](#Base-cell-size)\n",
    "- [Padding distance](#Padding-cells)\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters define our core mesh parameters. While each survey can have its own discretization (refinements), the joint inversion routine requires all meshes to have the same outer extent and base cell size. The following sections provide details on the choices made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mesh extent\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we need our three simulations (direct-current, magnetics and gravity) to have the same core parameters, we need to create a  \"combined\" survey that contains all source and receiver locations in our domain.\n",

    "### Base cell size\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to define a base cell size for the core region. A few criteria need to be taken into consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sources/receivers separation\n",
    "- Terrain clearance (height above ground)\n",
    "- Modeling resolution (size of the target)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the lowest drape height from the airborne magnetics is 60 m. As a general rule of thumb, numerical artefacts due to the discretization of topography decays sufficiently when receivers are roughly two cell distance away from the nearest edge or corner. Secondly, the dipole separation of the direct-current survey is 40 m. To improve numerical accuracy, we want to avoid computing potential differences within the same cell. This is guaranteed if the cell dimension is half the dipole separation, regardless of the dipole orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of interest covers roughly 2 km in width. As a general rule of thumb, the padding region should be at least as wide as the data extent in order to easy model features with wavelengths that may extend beyond the surveyed area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of EM modeling, we also need to consider the diffusion distance of the EM fields. The [skin depth](http://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/harmonic_planewaves_homogeneous/skindepth.html?highlight=skin%20depth#approximations) can be estimated by\n",

    "\n",
    "An octree mesh allows to increase the mesh resolution (smaller cells) in specific regions - warranted for either numerical accuracy or modeling purposes. Fine cells can be \"added\" to the octree grid using various insertion methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Radial: Add concentric spherical shells of cells around points. It is used for numerical accuracy near receiver poles (DC) and dipoles (EM).\n",
    "- Line: Add concentric tubes around line segments. It is the default discretization for line sources (EM loops)\n",
    "- Surface: Add layers of cells along triangulated surfaces in 3D. It is mostly used to refine known boundaries between geological domain and topography.\n",
    "- Horizon: Add horizontal layers of cells below a triangulated surface computed from the input object's vertices. This is a useful option to create a core region below the survey area.\n",

    "### For direct-current survey\n",
    "\n",
    "For EM methods, such as electrical direct-current surveys, the numerical accuracy of the forward simulation is the primary  factor to decide on a mesh refinement strategy. It is important to have several small cells around each source and receivers for solving partial differential equations accurately. In this case, dipole source and receivers use radial `ball` refinement was used to add concentric layers of cells around each source/receiver pairs.\n",

    "### For gravity and magnetic surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For potential field methods, the forward simulation is achieved via integration over prisms (linear operator) which is much less sensitive to the choice of discretization. Moreover, only cells below topography (active cells) are considered. For a more optimal mesh design, only fine cells are required at the air-ground interface. A `horizon` style refinement was used in order to add layers of fine cells below the footprint of the gravity and magnetic sensors. The maximum `distance` parameter was set to 100 m to reduce the number of small cells away from the receiver locations.\n",
