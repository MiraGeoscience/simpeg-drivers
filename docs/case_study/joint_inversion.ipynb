Both magnetization models have roughly the same amplitude and agree on the general shape of the central anomaly South of the ore shell. We note that the shape of the magnetic anomaly recovered with the joint method appears to be more compact in cross-section. This is likely due to the influence of the density model as already seen in its standalone result.\n",

Density values recovered by the joint inversion are significantly more smooth and correlated with the ore shell. In cross-section, we note a much more consistent density layering along topography. The joint model also highlighted a few deeper anomalies previously unseen in the standalone inversion. This is somewhat expected from the independent inversion of tensor data as they are insensitive to bulk property responses, only changes in physical properties.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint cross-gradient regularization has a significant impact on the results, generally yielding less complex models with coherent edges. While this result has yet to be validated with ground geological data, the joint models appear to fit fairly well with the inferred ore shell in terms of shape and physical property contrasts. The main benefeciary of the joint approach appears to be the gravity tensor data inversion. This is expected given that gradient data do not carry bulk density information. The FTG data can however provide information about edges and help delineate boundaries between petrophysical units. This is complementary to the bulk response measured by magnetics and EM systems."
