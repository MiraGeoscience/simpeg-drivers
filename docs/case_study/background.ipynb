    "This tutorial on geophysical inversion is framed around the well-known VMS deposit - the copper-zinc-gold Flin Flon mine in northern Manitoba, Canada. Our goal is to provided a step-by-step process to invert data from various geophysical methods and to test their resolving capabilities within a semi-realistic exploration context.\n",

    "The local geology of Flin Flon consists mainly of basalt and mafic volcanic formations (green and blue), with discrete occurrences of rhyolite units (yellow) that host the mineralization as shown in [Figure 2](setup_flinflon). \n",

    "The entire region was later deformed by large tectonic events that folded and faulted the stratigraphy in its current form. The mineralization occurs along thin lences dipping steeply towards the South-East. \n",

    "The area has been studied extensively over the years, yielding large amount of petrophysical data made available by [Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)](https://ostrnrcan-dostrncan.canada.ca/entities/publication/73d767d8-ee1c-4bab-a2da-52dcf83faa06), as shown in [Figure 3](global_map). \n",

    "The mineralization is expected to be much more conductive, dense and magnetic than the host rhyolite unit. The background mafic rocks are generally non-magnetic and moderately dense and resistive. We omitted all late-stage intrusives from the modeling for simplicity.\n",

    "From this simplified (conceptual) model of Flin Flon, we created a 3D petrophysical model around the mineralization [Figure 4](ore_body). We added a thick (40 m) overburden layer (tailings) of relatively low density and low resistivity to test the depth of penetration of the various survey types. This model was used to generate all the synthetic data used in this tutorial.\n",
