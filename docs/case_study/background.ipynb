This is contrast with the host rhyolite unit with low density, non-magnetic and highly resistive. The background mafic rocks are generally non-magnetic and have moderate densities and resistivities. A thick (40 m) overburden layer of relatively low density and  low resistivity covers the survey area.\n",
