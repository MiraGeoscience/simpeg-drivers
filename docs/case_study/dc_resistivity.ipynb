    "\n",
    "- The third refinement \"horizon\" is used to get a core region at depth with increasing cell size directly below the survey. This is our volume of interest most strongly influence by the data. We use a maximum distance of 100 m to limit the refinement away from the survey lines. In the case of remote electrodes, this parameter prevents from discretization finely everywhere in between.\n",
